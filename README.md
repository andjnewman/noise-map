> Example Noise Mapping Web App using Defra WMS services

##About

This repository contains a very simple [Leaflet JS](http://www.leafletjs.com) based web mapping application that displays the English Strategic Noise Mapping data published by Defra, through the [DataShare service](http://www.geostore.com/environment-agency).

* The app can be viewed at: [http://andjnewman.github.io/noise-map/leaflet-complete-noise.html](http://andjnewman.github.io/noise-map/leaflet-complete-noise.html)
* The code can be found in the gh-pages branch of this repository at: [https://github.com/andjnewman/noise-map/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/andjnewman/noise-map/tree/gh-pages)

##Credits
The app is based on code shared by [Astun Technology](https://astuntechnology.com) at [https://github.com/AstunTechnology/osgis-ol3-leaflet](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/osgis-ol3-leaflet) and also reuses the Astun Data Service to provide an OS backdrop (it is likely this will be switched to an alternative service as the app is further developed).
